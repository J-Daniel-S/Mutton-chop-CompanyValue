# Mutton-chop-CompanyValue
The proper repository for my company valuation application

This application is reliant upon a free API that is inconsistent and is known to change access policies.  I will check and update this app periodically but if they have made changes at Financial Management Planning I cannot guarantee that this application can still access their API.  Such is what we're left with when choosing from free APIs I suppose.

to run: either download the .jar attached to the release or just import the folder into your IDE and and run it.
