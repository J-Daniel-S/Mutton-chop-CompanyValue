# Mutton-chop-CompanyValue

PLEASE READ:
 The API I used for this application put up a pay wall a few months ago.  I'm not willing to pay $15 a month to keep this functional and I can't find another with the same level of detail that will cause this application to function.  If you want to see what my raw Java code looks like this is a good place to look but it doesn't work anymore sadly.

The proper repository for my company valuation application

This application is reliant upon a free API that is inconsistent and is known to change access policies.  I will check and update this app periodically but if they have made changes at Financial Management Planning I cannot guarantee that this application can still access their API.  Such is what we're left with when choosing from free APIs I suppose.

to run: either download the .jar attached to the release or just import the folder into your IDE and and run it.
